# DevAssessementWebsite

This is a project I built as way to assess my abilities in C# and Web apps using ASP.Net Core.

The login page looks like this:

The User Details Page looks like this :

The prompt I was provided with was very simple, if I were to give recommendations on this prompt, I would suggest Making password hashing a requirement as based on the prompt I was given password is stored in plaintext, which isn't best practice in the industry.
Furthermore this could have been completed in under 3 hours using ASP.Net Core Identity with razor pages, but would include extra information in the Users Table, that I felt would be overkill for this assessment.
